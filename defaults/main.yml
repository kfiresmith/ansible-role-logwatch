# defaults file for kfiresmith.logwatch

# Logwatch ignores strings for the logwatch ignores.conf file
# Each list entry must be a string that when encountered in the compiled
# logwatch report results in the full report line being discarded and
# replaced with a counter of ignored entries.
#
# IMPORTANT: You must escape any quotes for the string to match.
# For example, to ignore the string: apparmor="ALLOWED"
# you must create a single-line entry of: apparmor=\"ALLOWED\"
#
# List of strings to match which would then be ignored in report:
# logwatch_ignores:
#   - apparmor=\"ALLOWED\"
#   - ACPI BIOS Error
